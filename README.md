# Value-at-Risk-calculation-methods

This project implements multiple methods for calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using EUR/PLN exchange rate data. The methodologies include:

- Historical Simulation
- Historical Simulation with Weights
- Historical Simulation with Returns Scaled Using GARCH and EWMA Models
- Monte Carlo Simulation
To assess the performance of these risk estimation techniques, backtesting procedures are conducted, identifying the most effective approach.
